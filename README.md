# Song Voting Queue

A web application for groups/offices to play music together. Users can vote for the next song to be played from a playlist, and the song with the most votes is played next. This app is ideal for use in college groups, offices, or social gatherings where music is always playing and everyone wants to have a say in the next song.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

- **Video Voting**: Each video in the queue has upvote and downvote buttons that affect the videoâ€™s rank in the queue.
- **Now Playing**: Shows the currently playing video at the top of the app, automatically advancing to the next video when finished.
